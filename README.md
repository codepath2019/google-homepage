From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

What I learned:

1. What is the difference between inline, inline-block, and block elements?
2. Can you apply margin-top, margin-bottom to inline elements? Does it affect the parent container's height?
3. Can you apply padding-top, padding-bottom to inline elements? Does it afect the parent container's height?
4. What is one way to position/move block-level elements horizontally?
